## Exploring the Randomness of LLMs


LLM have become a the center all modern development from a core component of RAG systems to Agents that help us complete our daily task. Yet for more developer which use LLM for their daily workflows never spend spend time exploring their behaviors. Most of the user look at benchmark, use usage to in their day to day work, and Post on X to build their mental model of LLM capabilities.
I believe this is dangerous, because I creates a false gap between the people that use these models and the ones that can evaluate it. So I would like to share my experience playing our with llm to answer a simple questions.

## Can LLM generate random numbers

The question is a very simple and well understood on in industry. The model cannot generate a random number and do not possess the ability to generate random numbers. What I was curious that does model have a bias toward certain numbers, and does the bias change from different models. 


### Experiment 

I build a simple program to example 3 three things across different models

- What is the range of values when asked to guess random values

- What is the baies between the a uniform random prediction and the ones generated by the model

- How consistent the model is accross different trials

- How do the following experiments change when run on different models of the same family, and different family of models.
